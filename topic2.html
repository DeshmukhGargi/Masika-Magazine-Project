<h2> GREEN LIVING AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH </h2>
</head>
<body>
<p>Green living is adopting sustainable habits (reduce, reuse, recycle, conserve energy/water, eco-friendly products, plant-based diet) to protect nature, fight climate change, and improve personal/community health by reducing toxins, pollution, and resource depletion for a healthier planet and people. It directly links individual actions to a healthier environment (cleaner air/water, less waste) and better human well-being (fewer chemicals, more green spaces, cost savings).</p> 
<b>Core Principles of Green Living</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (The 3 Rs):</b> Minimize consumption, find new uses for items, and recycle properly to cut waste and resource strain.</li>
